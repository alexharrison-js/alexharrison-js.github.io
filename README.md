##### Currently Learning:
In my free time , when I am not teaching the above mentioned technologies, I enjoy reading books on system design, java and OOP concepts, design patterns, and algorithm design and optimization. I am currently reading about and foccussed on Node.js and reviewing Computer Science algorithms and data structures. I greatly enjoy listening to all of the modern podcasts currently out on cyber security, design concepts for larger systems, and comparison of different programming languages and technologies. I am currently focused on honing my algorithm design in Javascript by tackling kata and algorithm challenges (Codewars, CodeSignal, etc), as well as trying to understand Java and all that comes with it in depth so that I can start writing programs in Java effectively.
